### 1. Introduction

This contains standard guideline for implementing and understanding sushiscript. It's currently under construction and reflects the progress of implementation.

### 2. Lexical Structure

#### 2.1 Identifier

```
<identifier> = <ident head> <ident tail>*
<ident head> = <letter> | '_'
<ident tail> = <digit>  | <ident head>
```

##### 2.1.1 Keywords

Following identifiers are keywords:

```
or not and
define return export
if else
switch case default
for in break continue
redirect from to append here
```

#### 2.2 Punctuations

Following punctuations are meaningful:

```
+ - * // %
> < >= <= == !=
, = : ;
[ ] { } ( )
! $ " ' #
```

#### 2.3 Built-in Types

```
<built-in type>
	= "()"   | "Bool"    | "Char"  | "Int" | "String"   | "Function"
	| "Path" | "RelPath" | "Array" | "Map" | "ExitCode" | "FD"
```

#### 2.4 Character

```
<line break> = '\n'
<whitespace> = ' ' | '\t'
```

##### 2.4.1 Character Escaping

Special characters inside string-like token can be expressed by escaping character, by putting a `\\` before a character to escape it. There are different meaningful escaped character in different context (specified below).  **Escaping a character that doesn't have special meaning in current context preserves the original character.** In some contexts there are characters that have to be escaped to avoid lexical ambiguity.

_TODO: string escaped characters may be incomplete_

```
<tradition special> =
  '\' ('a' | 'b' | 'f' | 'n' | 'r' | 't' | 'v' | '\')
```


##### 2.4.2 Raw Mode

The raw mode of lexer is turned on in special contexts (typically when [invoking shell command](#3.1.4.2 Invoking Command)) where getting rid of the "lexical restriction" conforms better to the tradition of shell and is more intuitive and convenient for users.

```
<raw token>    = <raw char>*
<raw char>     = [^<raw restrict>] | <raw escape>
<raw restrict> = ' ' | ';' | '"' | "'" | '\' | '|' | ',' | ')' | ':' | '}'
<raw escape>   = '\' (<raw restrict> | <interpolate char>)
```

##### 2.4.3 Character inside `String` literal

```
<string char> = [^<string restrict>] | <string escape>
<string escape>
  = '\' ( <string restrict> | <interpolate char>)
  | <tradition special>
<string restrict> = '"'
```

##### 2.4.4 Character inside `Char` literal

```
<char char> = [^<char restrict>] | <tradition special>
<char restrict> = "'"
```

#### 2.5 Literals

##### 2.5.1 Bool & Unit & FD

```
<bool literal> = "true" | "false"
<unit literal> = "()"
<fd literal>   = "stdin" | "stdout" | "stderr"
```

##### 2.5.2 Integer

_TODO: integer literal of various radix support_

```
<integer> = ('+' | '-')? <digit>+
```

##### 2.5.3 Character

```
<char literal> = "'" <char char> "'"
```

##### 2.5.4 String

```
<string literal> = '"' ( <string char> | <interpolation> ) * '"'
```

##### 2.5.5 Path

```
<path literal> = "~" ('/' <path tail>)? | '/' <path tail>?
<relpath literal> = '.'+ ('/' <path tail>)?
<path tail>    = (<raw char> | <interpolation>)*
```

#### 2.6 Interpolation

Interpolation is a lexical construct that embed expression in some special contexts (typically string interpolation).

```
<interpolation> = "${" ... "}"
```

Interpolation can be recognized recursively. e.g.

```
${ ... "${ ... }" ... }
"${ ... "${ ... }" ... }"
```

##### 2.6.1 Interpolation Context

There are various contexts where interpolation can appear (such as `string literal`). The lexer yield control tokens to interact with the parser, so that the parser know when to:

1. Enter a interpolation context
2. Extract a "normal" string segment
3. Start parsing an interpolated expression
4. Exit the interpolation context

###### 2.6.1.1 Enter a Context

Each context has its unique indicator of entering its interpolation context. So the parser can start to parse corresponding literal.

###### 2.6.1.2 Extract a Segment

Depending on the character configuration of context, the lexer try to extract as many consecutive normal characters as possible to form a segment for the interpolation context.

###### 2.6.1.3 Start of Interpolated Expression

In all interpolation contexts, character sequence `${` is recognized as an indicator of the start of an interpolated expression. Then lexer enters the normal context for recognizing tokens for the following expression, until the parser recognizes a matching `}` for `${`, the interpolation context is resumed.

###### 2.6.1.4 Exit the Context

Depending on the character configuration of context, the lexer yields a control token to indicate the end of the interpolation context typically when a restricted character of the context is found, such as `"` for `string literal` and `<space>` for `path literal`.

###### 2.6.1.5 Example

```
"hello${a + b}!"
```

1. The first `"` is recognized as the start of an `string literal`
2. The segment `hello` is recognized.
3. `${` is recognized as the start of interpolated expression.
4. Then the normal context of lexer recognized `identifier: a`, `+` , `identifier: b` and `}`.
5. `}` is considered the end of interpolation expression. The parser tells lexer to resumed the interpolation context.
6. The segment `!` is recognized.
7. `"` is recognized as the end of the `string literal` and a control token is yielded.

#### 2.7 Misc

##### 2.7.1 Comment

When a hash tag `#` is recognized, any following character of the same line is regarded as comment and discarded by lexer.

```
<comment> = '#' <any character> $
```

##### 2.7.2 Indentation

Indent of length `N` is `N` consecutive white spaces at line start, no tab `\t` is allowed.

```
<indent N> = ^[ ]{n}
```

##### 2.7.3 Line Joining

When the last character of a line is `\`, **this backslash**, **next line break** and **indentation of next line** are ignored. And if the current line is empty, the only the indentation of next line will count.

### 3. Syntax Structure

#### 3.1 Expression

##### 3.1.1 Literals

	= <int literal>    | <bool literal>
	| <unit literal>   | <fd literal>

<array items>   = <expression> (',' <expression>)*
```

###### 3.1.1.2 Map Literal

```
<map literal> = '{' <map items>? '}'
<map items>   = <map item> (',' <map item>)*
<map item>    = <expression> ':' <expression>
```

##### 3.1.2 Atom Expression

```
<atom expr>  = <literal> | <identifier> | <paren expr> | <atom expr> <index>
<paren expr> = '(' <expression> ')'
<index>      = '[' <expression> ']'
```

##### 3.1.3 Operator Expression

###### 3.1.3.1 Binary Operator Expression

```
<binop expr> = <expression> <binary op> <expression>
<binary op>
	= '+'  | '-' | '*'  | '//'  | '%'
	| '>'  | '<' | '>=' | '<=' | '==' | '!='
	| "or" | "and"
```

###### 3.1.3.2 Binary Operator Precedence Table

| Operator          | Associativity | Precedence |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| `or` `and`        | left          | 0          |
| `== ` `!=`        | left          | 1          |
| `>` `<` `>=` `<=` | left          | 2          |
| `+` `-`           | left          | 3          |
| `*` `//` `%`       | left          | 4          |

###### 3.1.3.3 Unary Operator

```
<unop expr> = <unary op> <atom expr>
<unary op> = '+' | '-' | "not"
```

##### 3.1.4 Procedure Call

###### 3.1.4.1 Function Call

```
<function call> = <identifier> <atom expr>+
```

###### 3.1.4.2 Invoking Command

```
<command> = '!' <comamnd param>* <command end>
<command param>
  = <raw token>
  | <string literal>
  | <char literal>
<command end> = <line break> | ','
```

###### 3.1.4.4 Redirection

```
<redirection>   = "redirect" <redirect item> (',' <redirect item>)*
<redirect item> = <fd literal>? <redirect action>
<redirect action>
  = "to" (<expression> "append"? | "here")
  | "from" <expression>
```

###### 3.1.4.5 Procedure Call

```
<procedure call> = ( <function call> | <command> ) <redirection>? <pipeline>?
<pipeline> = '|' <procedure call>
```

##### 3.1.5 Expression

```
<expression>
  = <procedure call>
  | <atom expr>

```
<type> = <simple type> | <array type> | <map type> | <function type>
<simple type>
	= "Int"  | "Bool" | "String"
	| "Path" | "()"   | "FD" | "ExitCode"
<array type>    = "Array" <simple type>
<map type>      = "Map" <simple type> <simple type>
<function type> = "Function" <atom-type> <atom type>*
<atom type>     = <simple type> | '(' <type> ')'
```

#### 3.2 Statement

##### 3.2.1 Indentation Issue

If we say "`<statement>` introduces new block on `<program>`", all indentations of token in `<program>` must be greater than the line which the starting token of `<statement>` is in if `<program>` is in a different line, which means the following:

```
<indent N> <statement> ( <program> | <line break>
<indent (N+x)> <program> )
```

And all statements within the same innermost block must have same level of indentation.

If there's no line break before `<program>`, the indentation level of that block is the column number of the first token in that `<program>` minus 1.

##### 3.2.1 Definition

```
<definition> = <define var> | <define func>
```

###### 3.2.1.1 Variable Definition

```
<define var> =
  "export"? "define" <identifier> ( ':' <type> )? '=' <expression>
```

###### 3.2.1.2 Function Definition

```
<define func> =
  "export"? "define" <identifier> '(' <param list>? ')' (':' <type>)? '=' <program>
<param list>  = <param dec> (',' <param dec>)*
<param dec>   = <identifier> ':' <type>
```

`<define func>` introduces new block on `<program>`.

##### 3.2.2 Assignment

```
<assignment> = <expression> '=' <expression>
```

##### 3.2.3 return

`return` is used for returning from the control flow of current enclosing function.


```
<return> = return <expression>
```

##### 3.2.4 if

```
<if>   = "if" <expression> (':' | <line break>) <program> <else>?
<else> = "else" ':'? <program>
```

`<if>` and `<else>` both introduce new block on corresponding `<program>`.

The `if` and its matching `else` must be in same level of indentation, if two or more unmatched `if`s are in the same indentation level, next `else` will match the closest `if`.

#### 3.2.5 switch

```
<switch>  = "switch" <expression> <case>+ <default>?
<case>    = "case" <expression> (':' | <line break>) <program>
<default> = "default" ':'? <program>
```

`<case>` and `<default>` both introduce new block on corresponding `<program>`.

Indentations of `<case>`s must be equal or more than `<switch>`, and all indentations of `<case>`s must be identical.

##### 3.2.6 for

```
<for> = "for" <loop condition> ':' <loop body>
<loop condition>
  = <identifier> "in" <expression>
  | <expression>
<loop body> = ( <statement> | <break> | <continue> )*
```

`<for>` introduces new block on `<loop body>`.

###### 3.2.6.1 Loop Control

```
<break>    = "break" <integer>?
<continue> = "continue" <integer>?
```

##### 3.2.7 Program

```
<statement>
  = <expression>
  | <definition>
  | <assignment>
  | <if>
  | <switch>
  | <for>
<program> = <statement>*
```

### 4. Type System

#### 4.1 Introduction

The type system provide abstraction over many operating system concepts such as "Path" in filesystem and  the exit status of a process and distinguish one of those concepts from another on the aspect of language although their low level representations may be the same.

`sushiscript` is designed to be a staticly and strongly typed language. "Static" means that the type checking process on the type correctness of program is performed at compile time by the _type checker_. And "strong" means that there are few implicit conversions between different types are tried by type checker when the actual type of an expression and expected type are not exactly the same. (there are some, though).

The type system also has a strong connection with the syntax structure, every expression has a unambiguous type that depend on the context. And most `<expression>`s  appeared in the syntax structure means "expression of some certain types", expressions that aren't in the list of that "certain types" are rejected even if they are valid in syntax. And the requirements of types often distinguish different semantics of syntax structure.

#### 4.2 Notations and Terms

##### 4.2.1 `<E>` and `<S>`

We use `monospaced` string and angle bracket around them to represent some expandable syntactic rules. And `<E>` usually means some concrete `<expression>` and `<S>` usually means some concrete `<statement>`.

##### 4.2.2 `<E : T>`

When we add colon between the angle bracket like `<E : T>`. We means expression `<E>` has type `<T>`. It may be useful to explicity assign a type for the expression.

##### 4.2.3 Simple Types

Simple types (or atom types) are types that doesn't contains other types in itself.

##### 4.2.4 Parameterized Type

Parameterized type (as its name suggest) can be provided with type parameters to form (intuitively) different types with different parameters.

##### 4.2.5 Instantiation / Instantiate

An instantiation of a type parameter is the process where type parameter is replaced by a specific type when the actual type of the expression is known somehow from the context.

##### 4.2.5 Direct Sub-expresion

A expression `<E>` is a direct sub-expressions of a statement or an expression `<R>` if it's the first `<expression>` appeared in some path while walking down the parsing tree rooted at `<R>`.

##### 4.2.6 Super-expression

Opposite to "sub-expression", if `<E'>` is a sub-expression to `<E>`, then `<E>` is a super-expression of `<E'>`.

##### 4.2.6 Implicitly Convertible

Type `T` is_ implicitly convertible_ to type `T'` when there are built-in ~~or user-provided~~ ways to transform an object of type `T` to another object of type `T'`. And intuitively the process could be done implicitly, with no additional code written.

#### 4.3 Type Checking

##### 4.3.1 Well-typed Expression

The  _well-typed_ expression is recursively defined as follow:

- A literal of simple type is a well-typed expression
- An defined identifier is a well-typed expression
- Other expressions are well typed if all direct sub-expressions are well typed, and their types together satisfy one of the _typing rules_(explained later) of that composite expression.

##### 4.3.2 Type Requirement

A composite expression `<E : T>` or a statement `<S>` may explicitly _requires_ some of their direct sub-expressions `<E'>` to have some certain possible types `T1', T2', ...` in their typing rules R. Then these variable together forms a type requirement, and `T1', T2', ...` are the  _required types_ by `<E : T>` or `<S>` on `<E'>` in that requirement.

Sometimes the required types by `<E>` or `<S>` on `<E'>`may also depend on the types of other direct sub-expressions of `<E>` or `<S>` due to the typing rule.

##### 4.3.3 Implicit Type Conversion

With `<E'>` being an direct sub-expression of `<E : T>` or `<S>`, and its actual type being `T'`, an _implicit type conversion_(or _coersion_) happens when `T'` isn't one of the required types in the corresponding type requirement. And `T'` is _implicitly convertible_ to exactly one type `T''` in the required types. Then we say _`<E' : T'>` successfully implicitly convert to `T''` in the requirement_.

If there're multiple implicitly convertible type in required types, then conversion is considered ambiguous, which results in a fail implict conversion.

##### 4.3.4 Satisfaction Condition

We say _`<E' : T'>` satisfy the requirement by `<E : T>` or `<S>` on `<E'>`_ if one of the followings is true:

- `T'` is a same type as one of the required types by `<E>` or `<S>` on `<E'>`.
- `<E' : T'>` successfully convert to `T` in the requirement.
- ~~There's only one type in the required types, and `T'` unifies with that type. ~~

##### 4.3.3 Type Correctness

A _type correct program_(i.e. a program that pass the type checking process) means that type requirements recursively generate by **all** statements and composite expressions are _satisfied_ by their corresponding direct sub-expressions.

#### 4.4 Typing Rule

Typing rules, as mentioned in sections above, are the most important source of type requirements. And they usually come along with the semantic of the program. So they would be introduced together.

##### 4.4.1 Notation

We use a notation connected intimately with the notation that expressed syntax structure:

```
<expression : T> = <[optional-name :] T1> other tokens <T2>
# or
<statement> = <[optional-name :] T1> other tokens <T2 | T3>
```

where those enclosing in angle bracket are direct sub-expressions of the expression or statement with an optional name and type `T1, T2, T3, ...`. `T1, T2, T3, ...` may be specific types or just type pameters, either way, types with same name are the same type in the notation. Other tokens are no-longer enclosing in double or single quotes for clarity.

And what's on the left of the equal sign (`=`) of the rule is called the _head_ of the rule, the right is the _body_ of the rule.

##### 4.4.2 Type Deduction

Type deduction is performed **mostly bottom-up** and **always left-to-right** with respect to the abstract syntax tree. That is the type of the actual type of a super-expression is obtained by the type of  its sub-expressions and the applying typing rule.

##### 4.4.3 Requirement Generation

Whenever a type parameter in a rule is successfully deduced with a actual type `T`, all other type parameter with the same name (both in the _head_ and _body_) is instantiated with `T`.

A specific type `<E' : T'>` in the _body_, whenever it is instantiated, add `T'` to the required types by `<E : T>` on `<E'>`.  For example:

```
<E : T> = <E' : T'> <E'' : T'>
```

When `<E'>` is deduced with actual type `TA`, it instantiates the `T'` to `TA` in `<E''>`, and add `TA1` to the required types of `<E''>`. Then when `<E''>` is deduced with `TA2`, `<E'' : TA2>` is checked against the _satisfaction_ condition of the requirement with required type `TA1`.

#### 4.5 Built-in Types

##### 4.5.1 Simple Types

- `Unit`: "Trivial" type with only one value (`unit`)
- `Bool`:  Boolean types with only two different values (`true` and `false`)
- `Char`: Character _todo: specify the range of Char_
- `Int`: Signed integer  _todo: specify the range of Int_
- `String`: Character sequence.
- `Path`: Absolute path that may or may not pointing to a valid file
- `RelPath`: Relative path that may or may not pointing to a valid file
- `ExitCode`: Exit status of a process or command.
- `FD`: File descriptor is the logical handle of a opened file.

##### 4.5.2 Parameterized Types

- `Array [element]`: Linear sequence of values with simple type `[Element]`.
- `Map [Key] [Value]`: Associative structure that map a values of simple type `[Key]` to values of simple type `[Value]`.
- `Function [Ret] [Param1] [Param2] ...`: Function with parameters of type `[Param1], [Param2]` and return type `[Ret]`.

##### 4.5.3 Implicit Conversion

- `ExitCode` to `Bool`, non-zero `ExitCode` to `false` (exit with error), zero `ExitCode` to `true` (success).
- `ExitCode` to `Int`, converting the exit status code to the integer of same value.
- `RelPath` to `Path`, the relative path is applied to the current working directory.

#### 4.6 User-defined Types

_Not (planned to) implement yet_

#### 4.7 Typing Rules in `sushiscript`

##### 4.7.1 Array Literal

```
<array literal : Array T> = {<T>, <T>, ...} | {}
```

Array Literal is of type `Array T` when all of it's element are well-typed and of same type `T`.

##### 4.7.2 Map Literal

```
<map literal : Map K V> = {<K> : <V>, <K> : <V>, ...} | {}
```

Map Literal is of type `Map K V` when all of it's keys and values are well-typed and all keys are of the same type `K`, all values are of the same type `V`.

##### 4.7.3 Special Satisfaction Condition for Empty Array and Map

Empty array and map literals satisfy all requirement whose required types contains an array or map with any type parameter combination.

##### 4.7.4 Unary Operations

###### `+`

```
<abs : Int> : + <Int>
```

`+` as a unary operator turns an integer to its absolute value.

###### `-`

```
<negate : Int> = - <Int>
```

`-` as a unary operator turns an integer to its negative counter-part.

###### `not`

- `<redirect to here>` if the redirected command if a function call, the original return value of function is discarded(_todo: to be discussed_). The value of whole command expression is the output of the command as a string
- `<redirect output>` redirecting the output to the file pointing to by `Path` or another file discriptor
- `<redirect input>` redirecting the content of the file pointed by `Path` to the input file descriptor

##### 4.7.9 Variable Definition

<variable def> = define ident : type "=" <expr : T>
```

- if type of `ident` is explicitly stated, the statement generates type requirement on `<expr>` with required type represented by `type`, lets say `T'`, and make `ident` an well-typed expression of type `T'` in the following program.
- otherwise, if `expr` is an well-typed expression, then `ident` is an well-typed expression of type `T` in the following program.

##### 4.7.10 Assignment

```
<ident assign>    = <ident : T> = <expr : T>
<array index set> = <ident : Array T> [ <Int> ] = <T>
<map value set>   = <ident : Map K V> [ <K> ] = <V>
```

- `<ident assign>` assigning the value of `<expr>` to a identifier of type `T`
- `<array index set>` set the value of an array at integer index
- `<map value set>` set the value of an specific key, overwrite previous value if the value is set before.

##### 4.7.11 Function Definition and Return

```
<function def> = define func (p1 : type1, p2 : type2, ...) : type = ...
<return> = return <expr : T>
```

- If there is no function parameter, the default function parameter type is `()`.
- If return type of `func` is explicitly stated, the definition statement generates type requirements on all the `return` statement inside the body of the function with what's represented by type expression `type`. If all requirements are satisfied, `func` is an well-typed expression in the following program.
- Otherwise, the first `return` statement with no recursive call to `func` (calling `func` is not a sub-expression of `expr`) instantiate the type parameter `T` and generate type requirements on the expression of other return statements accordingly. Only if: **a.** Such `return` statement is found; **b.** All type requirements generated by this `return` statement are satisfied; then `func` becomes a well-typed expression in the following program.
- If `<expr>` in the return statement is omitted, `<expr>` is `unit` by default.


##### 4.7.12 If

```
<if> = if <Bool>: ...
       else if <Bool>: ...
```

The type of ondition expression of `if` statement is required to be `Bool`.

##### 4.7.13 Switch

```
<switch> = switch <T>
		   case <T>: ...
```

The required types of expression following `case` are:

- `T` requires `T` to be also `EqualComparable`(see `==`), and if two values are equal according to the equality comparison, the branch is chosen.
- `Function Bool T` calls the function with the switching value, if the function returns `true`, this branch is chosen.

##### 4.7.14 For

```
<normal for> = for <Bool>: ...
<range for> = for ident in <Array T>: ...
```

- `<normal for>` checks the loop condition before every iteration, if the expression evaluates to `true`, loop body is entered, the loop body is skipped otherwise.
- `<range for>` requires the range expression has an `Array T`, and the `ident` becomes an well-typed expression inside the loop body of type `T`.

### 5. Semantic

### 6. Translation

#### 6.0 Before Statements

##### 6.0.1 Scope

Unlike bash, statements like `if` / `for` have scope in sushi. To implement this, 

1. Sushi records all the definition in a scope, and when the scope exits, sushi does `unset` to all the variables.

	```bash
	if true:
	  define a : Int = 1
	  define b = "test"
	  
	-->
	
	if [[ 1 -ne 0 ]]; then
	  local a=$((1))
	  local b="test"
	  unset a
	  unset b
	fi
	```

	

2. If there are identifiers having the same name, sushi will translate them into different names by adding suffix `_scope_<num>`. (`<num>` is a number.)

	```bash
	define a = 1
	if true:
	  define a = 2
	  define b = "test"
	
	-->
	
	local a=$((1))
	if [[ 1 != 0 ]]; then
	  local a_scope_1=$((2))
	  local b="test"
	  unset a_scope_1
	  unset b
	fi
	```

##### 6.0.2 Temporary Variable

Temporary variables are like `_sushi_t_<num>_`. They are maintained by sushi.

##### 6.0.3 Built-in Variables/Functions

+ Identifiers with prefix `_sushi_` are usually a variable maintained by sushi. It's not recommended to use such identifiers directly.

+ Variables
  + `_sushi_unit_`: A special variable represent `Unit` in sushi. It has a read-only default value `0`.
  + `_sushi_func_ret_`: A variable temporarily store the function return.

+ Functions: **Return** means "echo ..."
  + `_sushi_abs_`: Get the absolute value of the parameter
    + Parameters: **1** parameter means the number to get abs.
    + Return: The absolute value of the parameter.
  + `_sushi_dup_str_`: Duplicate a string for particular times.
    + Parameters: **2** parameters. The 1st for the string to duplicate. The 2nd for times to duplicate.
    + Return: String par1 duplicated for par2 times.
  + `_sushi_path_concat_`: Concat 2 path.
    + Parameters: **2** parameters. 2 paths to concat.
    + Return: The concat res of 2 paths.
  + `_sushi_file_eq_`: Compare 2 file path.
  	+ Parameters: **2** parameters. 2 path to compare.
  	+ Return: `1` if 2 path refer to the same file, otherwise `0`. Besides, exit status will be `0` if they are the same, otherwise exit status will be `1 `(Opposite to the "echo return").

##### 6.0.4 "Code before"

One expression in sushi can be translated to a few lines bash script. To make it easier to explain, the translation is separated to 2 parts, which is "code before" and "value"(or "val").

"code before" means the code before "val", usually a few lines, and "val" is an expression of bash. "val" can be just an identifier. For example, to translate interpolation,

```
define a = "c"
define b = "d"
define c = "0" + "${"ab" + ${a + b}}"
```

-->

```bash
a="c"
b="d"
_sushi_t_0_="${a}${b}" # With post-order, the interpolation `${a + b}` is firstly translated and stored in a temporary variable _sushi_t_0_
_sushi_t_1_="ab${_sushi_t_0_}" # Then the interpolation `${"a" + "b" + ${a + b}}` is translated and stored in _sushi_t_1_, and this is the identifier the interpolation finally becomes
c="0${_sushi_t_1_}" # Use _sushi_t_1_ to replace the interpolation, this is like translating `define c = "0" + _sushi_t_1_`
```

For the interpolation `${"a" + "b" + ${a + b}}`,

```bash
# code before
_sushi_t_0_="${a}${b}"
_sushi_t_1_="ab${_sushi_t_0_}"
# val
${_sushi_t_1_} # this is what in "c=" assignment statement
```

#### 6.1 Assignment

###### `<variable | indexing> = <expr>`

Refer to **6.2.2 Variable** , **6.2.3 Literal** and **6.2.6 Indexing**.

**Note** that assignments on **Map** are different in "MapLit as right value" and "Map Variable as right value".

##### 6.1.1 Simple Type Assignment

`<t_lhs>=<t_rhs>`

##### 6.1.2 Array Assignment

`<t_lhs>=(<t_rhs>)`

##### 6.1.3 Map Assignment

`eval "<t_lhs>=(<t_rhs>)"`

#### 6.2 Expression

Except **Variable** and **Indexing**, the following expressions only have **right value** translation.

`<expr>` is expression in sushi, `<t_expr>` is the translated expression **"value"** in bash.

Because `<expr>` may be translated to multiple statements in bash, `<t_expr>` is only the **final identifier**;
Another situation is that `<expr>` can be translated directly to one expression in bash, then it will be the **expression** in bash (like `"string"`, `$((2 + 2))` and etc).

##### 6.2.1 Interpolation
Interpolation is that expressions can be interpolated in PathLit, RelPathLit, StringLit.
`<expr>` -> ``` $<t_expr> ```
`<t_expr>` is the identifier which `<expr>` finally becomes, but interpolation is usually translated to a few lines. Interpolations are traversed with post-order. Each expression in an interpolation will be translated and stored in a temporary variable. Finally, a temporary variable will replace the interpolation. An example is following.
```plain
define a = "c"
define b = "d"
define c = "0" + "${"ab" + ${a + b}}"
```

-->

```bash
a="c"
b="d"
_sushi_t_0_="${a}${b}" # With post-order, the interpolation `${a + b}` is firstly translated and stored in a temporary variable _sushi_t_0_
_sushi_t_1_="ab${_sushi_t_0_}" # Then the interpolation `${"a" + "b" + ${a + b}}` is translated and stored in _sushi_t_1_, and this is the identifier the interpolation finally becomes
c="0${_sushi_t_1_}" # Use _sushi_t_1_ to replace the interpolation, this is like translating `define c = "0" + _sushi_t_1_`
```
##### 6.2.2 Variable
As left value: `<identifier>` -> `<identifier>`
As right value: `<identifier>` -> 

- **Array type** as right value: `"${<t_id>[@]}"`

- **Map type** as right value:
  ```bash
  # code before
  _sushi_t_0_=`declare -p t_map`
  _sushi_t_0_=${_sushi_t_0_#*=}
  _sushi_t_0_=${_sushi_t_0_:1:-1}
  
  # val
  $_sushi_t_0_
  ```

  

- **Simple type**: `<identifier>` -> `$<identifier>`

Exception:
+ **Bool type** as condition (translation will be wrapped in `[[ ]]`): `<identifier>` -> `$<identifier> != 0`

##### 6.2.3 Literal

###### ArrayLit
`[<expr>, <expr>, ...]` -> `$<t_expr> $<t_expr> ...`
ArrayLit of `<expr>` is translated to **Indexed Array** in bash. It's `<expr>s` split by space character. `<expr>s` can only be simple types and they have the same types.

As right value in assignment: `true` -> `1`, `false` -> `0`

###### CharLit
`'c'` -> `"c"`
CharLit will be translated directly into string.

###### FdLit
`stdin` -> `0`
`stdout` -> `1`
`stderr` -> `2`
FdLit will be translated to the relative number.

###### IntLit
`100` -> `$((100))`
IntLit will be translated to "arithmetic" in bash. Int literal will be wrapped by `$(( ))`.

###### MapLit
`{ <expr> : <expr>, <expr> : <expr>, ... }` -> `[$<t_expr>]=$<t_expr> [$<t_expr>]=$<t_expr> ...`
MapLit of `<expr>` is translated to **Associative Array** in bash. K-V pairs are like `[<key>]=<value>`, and they are split by space character.

###### PathLit
This is an interpolated string, refer to **Interpolation** part.

###### RelPathLit
This is an interpolated string, refer to **Interpolation** part.

###### StringLit
This is an interpolated string, refer to **Interpolation** part.

###### UnitLit
`Unit` is a type in sushi. It will be translated to a special variable in bash named `_sushi_unit_`.

##### 6.2.4 UnaryExpr
###### Not (`not`)

+ **Bool** not:
  + As condition wrapped in `[[ ]]`: `(! $<t_expr> -ne 0)`
    `not` will be translated to `!`.
  + As right value in assignment: `$((! $<t_expr>))`
###### Pos (`+`)
+ **Int** abs: `+<expr>` -> ``` `_sushi_abs_ $<t_expr>` ```
	`_sushi_abs_` is a function that return absolute value of the 1st parameter.
	`+` is only applied to Int type. It will be translated to "pass `<t_expr>` to a built-in function `_sushi_abs_` and get its output" like above.
###### Neg (`-`)
+ **Int** neg: `-<expr>` -> `$((-$<t_expr>))`
`-` is only applied to Int type. It will be translated to "a `$(( ))` wraps `-$<t_expr>`" like above.

+ **String** concat: `"${<t_expr>}${<t_expr>}"`
+ **Array** concat: `<expr>` may be ArrayLit/Variable.
	+ ArrayLit: `<t_expr>` without `( )`. `<t_expr>` will be elements in array split by space.

	+ Variable: `${<t_expr>[@]}`. `<t_expr>` will be an identifier in bash.
		e.g. `arr` -> `${arr[@]}`
	+ The final result will be stored in a temp variable, and `<t_expr>` is its identifier. For example,
```bash
define arr = [1, 2]
define res = arr + [3, 4] + [5, 6]
-->
local -a arr=(1 2)
_sushi_t_0_=(${arr[@]} 3 4)

		e.g. `{"k0": 1, "k1": 2}` -> `["k0"]=1 ["k1"]=2` (ArrayLit is translated to `(["k0"]=1 ["k1"]=2)` in general, but different here.)
	+ Variable: ``` `_sushi_extract_map_ ${!<t_expr>[@]} ${<t_expr>[@]}` ```. `<t_expr>` will be an identifier in bash. (`_sushi_extract_map_` is a built-in function. It receives the keys and values from parameter, and return a string like `["key0"]=val0 ["key1"]=val1 ["key2"]=val2 ...`)
		e.g. `arr` -> `${arr[@]}`
	+ The final result will be stored in a temp variable, and `<t_expr>` is its identifier. For example,

define res = map + {"c": 3, "d": 4} + {"e": 5, "f": 6}
-->
local -A map=(["a"]=$((1)) ["b"]="c")
_sushi_t_0_=(`_sushi_extract_map_ ${!map[@]} ${map[@]}` ["c"]=$((3)) ["d"]=$((4)))

###### Redirection

> As described in **4.7.8 Redirection**
```plain
<redirect to here : String> = (<function call : Ret> | command) redirect to here
<redirect output> = redirect <FdLit>? to <Path | FD>
<redirect input>  = redirect <FdLit>? from <Path>
```

+ **redirect to here**
	+ CommandLike with **redirect to here** will be wrapped by double ``` ` ```. It's like ``` `<t_func_call>` ``` or ``` `<t_command>` ```.
+ **redirect input/output**
	`redirect <FdLit> {to|from} <Path | FD> {append}?` ->

###### Command

`! <cmd> <params> <redirection>` ->
+ `<t_cmd> <t_params> <t_redir>; _sushi_t_0_=$?` if not "to here"
+ ```_sushi_t_0_=`<t_cmd> <t_params> <t_redir>` ``` if "to here"

The final identifier(`<t_expr>`) is `"_sushi_t_0_"` (0 may be changed to other number depending on the current temp variables count).

`<cmd>` is an interpolation and `<params>` is a group of interpolation, so they are translated as how interpolations are translated. `<redirection>` is translated as described above.

###### FunctionCall

`<func> <params> <redirection>` ->

- `<t_func> <t_params> <t_redir>; _sushi_t_0_=$_sushi_func_ret_` if not "to here"`
	- `_sushi_t_0_` 's assignment may be different depending on the **return type**
- ```_sushi_t_0_=`<t_func> <t_params> <t_redir>` ``` if "to here"

The final identifier(`<t_expr>`) is `"_sushi_t_0_"` (0 may be changed to other number depending on the current temp variables count).

Detail:

+ `<func>`
  + Function identifier name.
+ `<params>`
  + All the params will be translated to variable in bash, and be used as reference in function.
  + If Literal is used in function call, it will be stored in a temp variable first.
+ `<redirection>`
  + See above.
+ Function's return will be restored in a global variable `_sushi_func_ret_`

###### As right value

Code before is like above, val is `_sushi_t_0_`

##### 6.2.6 Indexing

`<expr0>[<expr1>]` ->

+ As right value
	+ **Array**: `${<t_expr0>[<t_expr1>]}`
	  + `<expr1>` must be Int type.
	+ **Map**: `${t_expr0}[<t_expr1>]`
	  + `<expr1>` must be String type.
+ As left value
	+ `<t_expr0>[<t_expr1>]`



#### 6.3 VariableDef

`export? define <id> (: <type>)? = <expr>` ->

+ `local <id>=<t_expr>` if not export
+ `declare -gx <id>=<t_expr>` if export
+ `<type>` is ignored in translation. `<t_expr>` is the translation's final identifier like described before.
+ Declaration with assignment is relative to assignment. Refer to **6.1 Assignment**

Exception:

+ **Map**: Declare and then assignment. If right value is variable, translation result declare the variable first, and use `eval` to assign. Otherwise, if right value is MapLit, no `eval` is needed (Refer to **6.1 Assignment**) For example

```bash
define m : Map String Int = { "a": 1, "b": 2 }
define m_0 : Map String Int = m

-->

local -A m=(["a"]=1 ["b"]=2)
local -A m_0=(); eval "m_0=(`_sushi_extract_map_ ${!<m>[@]} ${<m>[@]}`)"
```

#### 6.4 FunctionDef

```
export? define <id> (<params>) =
  <program>
```

->

+ Function name is `<id>`.
+ Parameters' translations are to get parameters' references:
  + `local -n <param_id>=$1`
+ Parameters are acquired inside the function body and before all the other statement
+ `export -f <id>` will be below the function definition if "export"

For example,

```bash
export define foo (a : Int, b : Array Int, c : String Int) =
  ! echo "${a}"

-->

foo () {
  local -n a=$1
  local -n b=$2
  local -n c=$3
  local _sushi_t_0_=${a}
  echo "${_sushi_t_0_}"
}
export foo
```



#### 6.5 ReturnStmt

`return <expr>` ->

+ Return type is not Bool`_sushi_func_ret_=<t_expr>; return 0`

+ Return type is Bool 

	```bash
	_sushi_func_ret_=<t_expr>
	if [[ _sushi_func_ret_ -ne 0 ]]; then
	  return 0
	else
	  return 1
	fi
	```

Assignment may be different depending on `<expr>` type.

#### 6.6 IfStmt

```plain
if <expr>: <program>
else: <program>?
```

-->

```bash
if [[ <t_expr> ]]; then
  <t_program>
else
  <t_program>
fi
```

`<expr>` can only be Bool type.

#### 6.7 Switch

```
switch <val : T>
case <cond : T>:
  <program0>
case <cond_func : Function Bool T>:
  <program1>
default:
  <program2>
```

-->

```bash
if [[ <t_val> == <t_cond> ]]; then
  <t_program0>
elif <t_cond_func> <t_val>
  <t_program1>
else
  <t_program2>
fi
```



#### 6.8 ForStmt

#### For as while

```
for <expr>:
  <program>
```
-->
```bash
while [[ <t_expr> ]]; do
  <t_program>
done
```

`<expr>` above can only be Bool type.

#### For to iterate

```
for <ident> in <expr>:
  <program>
```
-->
```bash
for <ident> in ${<t_expr>[@]}; do
  <t_program>
done
```

`<expr>` above can only be Array type.



#### 6.9 LoopControlStmt

`break <num>` -> `break <num>`


##  特性

### 抽象语法树

和简化的传统编译器架构类似，`sushiscript`实现分为三大部分：编译器前端，分析与检查，以及代码生成。但为了实现简单和分工方便的考虑：前端部分目前细分为**词法分析**（`sushi/lexer`）和**语法分析**（`sushi/parser`）两阶段，分析与检查又分为**作用域分析**（`sushi/scope`）以及**类型检查**（`sushi/type-system/type-check`）两阶段。每个阶段在实现上均假设输入的各种性质完全正确，并且各自产生自己的错误，顶层的**流水线**（`sushi/pipeline`）按顺序执行每一个阶段，并把上一阶段的输出传递给下一阶段，如果在任何一个阶段遇到错误，则将错误输出并退出。上述几乎所有的阶段（除了词法分析以外）都需要围绕抽象语法树来进行，所以这里简单介绍一下。语法树的完整实现见[`sushi/ast/`](https://github.com/Sushiscript/sushiscript/tree/master/include/sushi/ast)。

语法树类型是语言的语法结构在编程语言中的抽象表示，本质上是递归的数据类型（[recursive data type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_data_type))。映射到c++也就是用基于指针的链式结构来表达递归（实现上用了`std::unique_ptr`）。因此语法树整体上和[文档](https://github.com/Sushiscript/sushiscript/blob/master/docs/language-specification.md)中的语法结构完全一致（大体上分为[`sushi::ast::Statement`](https://github.com/Sushiscript/sushiscript/blob/master/include/sushi/ast/statement/statement.h)以及[`sushi::ast::Expression`](https://github.com/Sushiscript/sushiscript/blob/master/include/sushi/ast/expression/expression.h)），因此具体的结构在这里不详述。

### 语法与词法分析

编译器前端的工作是以线性字符流来构造抽象语法树。其中在逻辑上首先把线性的字符流转化成线性的Token流（Token实现见：[`sushi/ast/token.h`](https://github.com/Sushiscript/sushiscript/blob/master/include/sushi/lexer/token.h)），之后再用Token流来构造语法树。

#### 常规语法分析和词法分析

`sushiscript`的词法和语法分析器完全手写，且基于一个[`LookaheadStream`](https://github.com/Sushiscript/sushiscript/blob/master/include/sushi/lexer/detail/lookahead-stream.h)的抽象，这个抽象使得我们可以轻易地在不消耗字符流的情况下获取字符流头部的内容，这样不管在控制字符流（[`sushi/lexer/detail/source-stream.h`](https://github.com/Sushiscript/sushiscript/blob/master/include/sushi/lexer/detail/source-stream.h)或者token流上都非常方便。

常规的词法分析部分大致是一个不严谨的自动机，通过lookahead来判断下一步需要提取的token，[`sushi/lexer/context.cpp`](#link-todo)和[`sushi/lexer/lexeme.cpp`](#link-todo)包含了一般的lookahead之后dispatch，并且在这个过程中修改[自动机状态](#link-todo)。

常规的parser部分是常规的手写parser实现：不严谨的类LL(k)的top-down parser加上[operator precedence parser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_precedence_parser)来处理二元运算符优先级的情况（[`sushi/parser/parser.cpp`](#link-todo) 包含了parser的完整实现，文件比较长不过都是基于语法结构的top-down parsing）。

#### 字符串插值与context

几乎整个前端的难度都落在实现编译期的[字符串插值](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_interpolation)上。简言之，为了实现字符串插值，lexer在提取字符串的过程中还需要检测“插值”开始的信号，并且在插值开始后要产生正常状态下的token，之后需要在“合适的时机”切换回提取字符串的模式。

因此我们引入上下文（context）的概念，在lexer提取字符串，路径等字面值时，从普通上下文进入一个“可被插值”的上下文，这个上下文中允许的字符依赖字面值的类型有不同，当然这个性质也被抽象出来了（见[`sushi/lexer/detail/character-config.h`](#link-todo)）。在可被插值上下文中，lexer检测插值的开始，插值开始后，lexer再次进入普通上下文。那么这个因插值产生的普通上下文何时结束呢？这里就需要parser的配合，parser需要在插值开始后，监测插值的结束，并且在插值结束后通知lexer返回之前的可插值上下文。可插值上下文的主要实现见[`sushi/lexer/context.h`](#link-todo)。插值过程中lexer和parser之间通过token传递信息的方式见**_文档2.6: Interpolation Context_**，对于可插值的字面值，见文档中词法结构中出现`<interpolation>`的位置。

剩下的问题就是解耦上下文产生token以及lexer和上下文交互的过程，这里的实现借鉴了[状态模式](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_pattern)，只不过这里的状态不仅仅是一个状态，而是一个状态栈。不同的上下文在产生token时，同时产生控制信息，告诉lexer是应该1. 进入一个新的上下文 2. 退出当前上下文 3. 保持当前上下文。lexer对上下文产生消息的反应见[`sushi/lexer/lexer.h: Lexer::ExecuteAction()`](#link-todo)

### 作用域生成与检查

Scope 即作用域，其中记录着该作用域中定义的标识符。在遍历语法树时，遇到 **变量定义**、**函数定义**、**基于range的for语句** 则要在相应作用域插入标识符，下面将这几种情况总称为“定义”。

Environment 中提供 通过`Program`（语法上函数体/if语句主体等称为`Program`）获取`Scope`、通过`Identifier`获取“使用它的”`Scope` 和 通过语法树中的表达式获取其类型 三个接口。其中除了获取类型的接口内部的数据由下一阶段生成，另外两个接口的内部数据由本阶段完成。

本阶段实现方法是，遍历语法树：

+ 当遇到 Program 时，生成新的 Scope ，并将该 Program 与该 Scope 的对应关系存入Environment
+ 当遇到对标识符的 **使用** 时，搜索该标识符是否已经在作用域（包括父作用域）中有定义，如果有，则将 该标识符 与 当前的（即使用该标识符的）Scope 的对应关系插入到Environment中；如果没有，则是未定义错误
+ 当遇到对标识符的 **定义** 时，搜索该标识符是否已经在 **同一个** 作用域中有定义，如果有，则是重定义错误；如果没有，则向当前所在的 Scope 插入该标识符的信息

该阶段的实现难度不大，主要难度在于如何测试生成的 Environment 和 Scope 的正确性。当前的测试方法是: 按从上到下的顺序得到所有 Scope 和所有 Identifier，测试时输入每个 Scope 中所有的标识符 和 每个 Identifier 对应的“使用它的” Scope 来进行验证。

### 类型推导与检查

类型推导负责在Environment中补充`Expression`和`Type`的对应关系。具体的体现形式是`Expression`在抽象语法树中的地址与`Type`的映射。

在类型推导上，_文档4.3与4.4_详细阐述了`sushiscript`中类型的推导规则，在这里也不详述。文档中的大部分规则和定义都是为了严谨考虑，所以看上去会比较生涩。简言之，在绝大多数的情况下都是十分常规的基于语法树自下而上的类型推导。由于目前`sushiscript`中没有泛型，类型系统整体来说规则也相对简单，在明确类型的推导规则，隐式转换规则以及正确地实现了`Type`这一抽象之后，在实现上基本没有什么特别大的难度。

`sushiscript`中类型的抽象见[`sushi/type-system/type.h`](#link-todo)，对于表达式类型推导以及语句中涉及的类型检查，分别见[`sushi/type-system/expression.cpp`](#link-todo)与[`sushi/type-system/statement.cpp`](#link-todo)。整个实现的核心是`expression.cpp`中的`SolveRequirement()`和`RequireSatisfy()`，剩下的对语法树的后序遍历，以及把推导出来的类型正确放到`Environment`中，以及正确地产生错误都是基于文档的苦力活了。

### 代码生成

代码生成是在以上阶段都完成之后，通过 lexer/parse 阶段 生成的语法树 和 作用域生成/类型推导与检查阶段 生成的 Environment 来生成最终的代码 (当前只支持生成为 `bash`)。

代码生成部分的核心部分——也是难点部分在于如何将语法树的内容完整地对应到目标语言中，这要求对目标语言也有较多的了解；此外，还要考虑如何在目标代码中实现一些前端语言有而目标语言没有的特性。下面阐述的是代码生成的几个难点问题

1. Scope: 在 bash 语言中，虽有 `local` 声明符，但是其作用只是将变量作用域限制在函数中，而在 if/for 等语句中不存在作用域，那么在代码生成中就需要一些操作让他们“变得”有作用域。其实现方法是
	1. 对所有 “定义” ，都会先搜索相同标识符是否在作用域（包括父作用域）中有定义，如果有，则添加特定后缀让它们在生成的代码不同
	2. 对所有的 Program 中定义的变量，在 Program 代码生成的最后会对所有新变量进行 `unset`
2. 某些在 `sushiscript` 中的表达式，在 `bash` 中需要翻译为 多条表达式/语句 ，对于这种情况，代码生成中所有表达式的翻译结果都会包含两部分，分别是 `code_before` 和 `val` —— `code_before` 是该表达式的前置语句， `val` 是该 `sushiscript` 表达式最终形成的 `bash` 表达式，通常 `val` 的形式是 `${identifier}`；某些情况下可能上层的翻译只想要 `bash` 表达式的 `bash` 标识符，因此翻译时除了生成 `code_before` 和 `val` ，还会生成 `raw_id` 表示这只是一个标识符。
3. 为了简化翻译代码、实现某些功能，代码生成会在 `bash` 脚本中加入一些“`sushiscript`内建变量/函数”，如：
	1. `bash` 中函数的 return 返回的是表示 Exit Status 的整数，而 `sushiscript` 支持的是 return 任何类型。代码生成实现的方法是使用 `_sushi_func_ret_` 变量，存储函数中的“返回值”
	2. `sushiscript` 支持对字符串使用 `*` 运算符，表示重复该字符串多次。代码生成实现的方法是内建一个函数 `_sushi_dup_str_` 来简化翻译

关于代码生成更详细的规则，在文档第 6 章有阐述，此处不作赘述。

### 整合与命令行接口

命令行接口部分工作总体难度较低，可以划分为
1. 制定命令行参数标准。这里参考了`python`，`javac`，`dotnet`等的参数设计，最终敲定。
2. 实现命令行参数处理部分并添加测试样例。这个就是简单的字符序列的处理，测试也比较容易。
3. 调用前几层的工作转换`sushiscript`为`shell script`。这是整个程序的核心部分，中间需要对前几个层次的异常做出处理。
4. 将各个`pipeline`部分串联起来，比如使用一个`config`来传递参数，`run`和`build`公用相同的核心处理函数。
